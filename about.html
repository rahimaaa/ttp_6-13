  <p>Dogs are starving to death!

      In the poor farm town of Calvinia, South Africa, more than 1,000 dogs are starving to death. 
      The cause is a severe 8-year-long drought, compounded by COVID, which has brought desperate poverty. 
      Crops have failed, and many farmworkers have lost their jobs which means they can’t afford to feed their dogs.
      
      The scene on the ground is one of extreme and prolonged suffering, inevitably resulting in a 
      terrible death for these famished dogs. We must rush emergency food to the area to help them.
       Please help!

      The suffering doesn’t stop at hunger. Disease and abuse are also rampant in the town.
Dogs are suffering from eye infections and sexually transmitted diseases and are covered in fleas.
